Car Booking


Two different applications for user and driver:

User Application:

The user application facilitates customers in locating and tracking their assigned drivers in real-time during the car booking process. Here's an outline of its core feature:

Real-time Driver Location Tracking: Utilizing the Kafka messaging system, the user application subscribes to a topic where the driver application publishes real-time location updates. These updates include latitude, longitude, and possibly other relevant information such as driver ID and timestamp.
Subscription to Kafka Topic: The user application subscribes to a dedicated Kafka topic specifically designed for transmitting driver location data. This ensures efficient and real-time communication between the driver and user applications.

Driver Application:

The driver application complements the user application by periodically sending real-time location updates to the Kafka topic subscribed to by the user application. Here's an overview of its role in the system:

Location Data Publication: The driver application periodically publishes location updates to the designated Kafka topic. These updates contain the current geographical coordinates of the driver's vehicle, allowing users to track their location in real-time.
Integration with Kafka Producer: The driver application integrates with Kafka as a producer, enabling it to publish location data messages to the Kafka topic subscribed to by the user application.
